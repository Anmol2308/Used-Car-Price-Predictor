# Used Car Price Predictor
This project uses interactive data to predict the price of used cars. This model helps users to get best resell value of their used cars. I have taken the data from kaggle and used Linear Regressor Model which gave me the accuracy of 0.89. I will still work on this to make it more accurate and look more better.

#### About Data:
Data consist of five features on the basis of which the price is predicted:
* Company of the car
* Model of the car
* Year of purchase
* Fuel type 
* Number of kilometers the car has travelled

#### Inside the Project:
* Building the Model:
--> Data cleaning
--> Data preprocessing
--> Used linear regression model
--> Tried to improve the accuracy of the model by changing different random states
* Making the flask app
--> Made a interactive user friendly flask app
--> Used html and css for front end of the web app
--> Used javascript jinja2 for the backend
#### Deployment of the app:
  I have deployed the web app on pythonanywhere. You can check it out on: anmol23.pythonanywhere.com
